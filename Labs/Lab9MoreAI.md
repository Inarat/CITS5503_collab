## Travel Chatbot

### Background

The aim of this lab is to write a program that will do simple question and answers with someone that is reporting a travel itinerary. It will take unstructured conversational text and create an itinerary of where people travelled and what they visited. It will prompt for a comment about the trip and detect the sentiment, responding in an appropriate way.

The documentation for the Amazon Comprehend is https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-it-works.html



### [Step 1] Build the itinerary

The program should start with an explanation of what it will do and then ask for the first part of the itinerary.

The program will prompt the user as follows:

```
> You can tell me “who” is going “where” on what “date” to see “what”
```

The person can then enter text such as:

```
> John and Mary Jones travelled to Paris on the 15th of October 2018 to see the Eiffel Tower
```

The program will validate this and then create an itinerary entry:

```
Person: John
Person: Mary Jones
Travelling to: Berlin
On: 15/10/2018
Reason: see the Eiffel Tower
```

If the text being entered leaves out any of the components, the program should prompt for that information:

e.g. 

```
> Who is travelling to Paris?
```

Of course, if the location or date is left out, these should be prompted for as well:

```
> Where are you going?

> On what date will you be travelling?

> What did you see?
```

### [Step 2] Sentiment Analysis

Add to the program you wrote in Step [1] by using AWS Comprehend and allow the user to enter a comment on what they thought of the trip and detect the sentiment of the comment. Depending on the sentiment, reply with an appropriate response:

If the sentiment was positive: “That sounds like you had a great time”
If the sentiment was negative: “I am sorry to hear that”
If the sentiment was neutral: “That sounds interesting”


## Create a Lex Chatbot


Write two bash scripts.  
The first will create the chatbot, the second will take input from the command line and use the commands to test the chat bot.


### [Step 3] Create a custom slot type

Using the AWS CLI, create a custom slot type using the following json
file

Note: Student Number can't be used in making the names unique because
the names need to haver non-numeral characters. Use your name instead.

```
{
    "enumerationValues": [
        {
            "value": "tulips"
        },
        {
            "value": "lilies"
        },
        {
            "value": "roses"
        }
    ],
    "name": "<Your Name>FlowerTypes",
    "description": "Types of flowers to pick up"
}
```

and the following command:

```
aws lex-models put-slot-type \
    --region region \
    --name <Your Name>FlowerTypes \
    --cli-input-json file://FlowerTypes.json
```
	
###  [Step 3] Create an intent

Using the AWS CLI, create the intent using the following json file

```
{
    "confirmationPrompt": {
        "maxAttempts": 2,
        "messages": [
            {
                "content": "Okay, your {FlowerType} will be ready for pickup by {PickupTime} on {PickupDate}.  Does this sound okay?",
                "contentType": "PlainText"
            }
        ]
    },
    "name": "<Your Name>OrderFlowers",
    "rejectionStatement": {
        "messages": [
            {
                "content": "Okay, I will not place your order.",
                "contentType": "PlainText"
            }
        ]
    },
    "sampleUtterances": [
        "I would like to pick up flowers",
        "I would like to order some flowers"
    ],
    "slots": [
        {
            "slotType": "FlowerTypes",
            "name": "FlowerType",
            "slotConstraint": "Required",
            "valueElicitationPrompt": {
                "maxAttempts": 2,
                "messages": [
                    {
                        "content": "What type of flowers would you like to order?",
                        "contentType": "PlainText"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "priority": 1,
            "slotTypeVersion": "$LATEST",
            "sampleUtterances": [
                "I would like to order {FlowerType}"
            ],
            "description": "The type of flowers to pick up"
        },
        {
            "slotType": "AMAZON.DATE",
            "name": "PickupDate",
            "slotConstraint": "Required",
            "valueElicitationPrompt": {
                "maxAttempts": 2,
                "messages": [
                    {
                        "content": "What day do you want the {FlowerType} to be picked up?",
                        "contentType": "PlainText"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "priority": 2,
            "description": "The date to pick up the flowers"
        },
        {
            "slotType": "AMAZON.TIME",
            "name": "PickupTime",
            "slotConstraint": "Required",
            "valueElicitationPrompt": {
                "maxAttempts": 2,
                "messages": [
                    {
                        "content": "Pick up the {FlowerType} at what time on {PickupDate}?",
                        "contentType": "PlainText"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "priority": 3,
            "description": "The time to pick up the flowers"
        }
    ],
    "fulfillmentActivity": {
        "type": "ReturnIntent"
    },
    "description": "Intent to order a bouquet of flowers for pick up"
}

```

using the following command

```
aws lex-models put-intent \
   --region region \
   --name <Your Name>OrderFlowers \
   --cli-input-json file://OrderFlowers.json
```
   
### [Step 4] Create the bot

Use the following json

```
{
    "intents": [
        {
            "intentVersion": "$LATEST",
            "intentName": "OrderFlowers"
        }
    ],
    "name": "<Your Name>OrderFlowersBot",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "abortStatement": {
        "messages": [
            {
                "content": "Sorry, I'm not able to assist at this time",
                "contentType": "PlainText"
            }
        ]
    },
    "clarificationPrompt": {
        "maxAttempts": 2,
        "messages": [
            {
                "content": "I didn't understand you, what would you like to do?",
                "contentType": "PlainText"
            }
        ]
    },
    "voiceId": "Salli",
    "childDirected": false,
    "idleSessionTTLInSeconds": 600,
    "description": "Bot to order flowers on the behalf of a user"
}
```

and the following command

```
aws lex-models put-bot \
    --region region \
    --name <Your Name>OrderFlowersBot \
    --cli-input-json file://OrderFlowersBot.json
```
	
This will take a little bit of time to create so use this command to see if it is ready:

```
aws lex-models get-bot \
    --region region \
    --name <Your Name>OrderFlowersBot \
    --version-or-alias "\$LATEST"
```
	
### [Step 5] Get input to test the bot

Write a shell script (or Python program) to interact with the chatbot. Get input from the command line to send using the commands listed below:



```
aws lex-runtime post-text \
    --region region \
    --bot-name <Your Name>OrderFlowersBot \
    --bot-alias "\$LATEST" \
    --user-id UserOne \
    --input-text <INPUT>

```

### [Step 6] Make sure all resources are deleted when complete



**REMEMBER**

You will be awarded zero marks If we don't see evidence that you ran the python app or
scripts.

We will deduct marks if you fail to name resources correctly with your
student number.

We will deduct marks if you fail to clean up resources you  have created.
