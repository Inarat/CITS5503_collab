# Practical Worksheet 2
Version: 1.0 Date: 10/04/2018 Author: David Glance

## Learning Objectives
1. Create an EC2 instance, security group and ssh keys using awscli and python/boto
2. Configure VirtualBox to allow for inbound IP traffic
3. Install and configure Docker and run a hello world application that can be called from the host machine

## Technologies Covered

* Ubuntu
* AWS
* AWS EC2 Python/Boto/awscli/bash scripts VirtualBox
* Docker

Note: Do this from your VirtualBox VM – if you do it from any other platform (Windows, Mac – you will need to resolve any potential issues yourself)

## Create an EC2 instance using awscli
### [1] Create a security group

```
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name <student number>-sg --description "security group for development environment"
```

Note: this will use the default VPC (you will learn about this later in the course) – if you want to specify another VPC, you would use --vpc-id vpc-xxxxxxxx

Note the security group id that is created

### [2] Authorise inbound traffic for ssh

```
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name <student number>-sg --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

### [3] Create a key pair that will allow you to ssh to the EC2 instance

```
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name <student number>-key --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > <student number>-key.pem
```

To use this key on Linux, copy the file to a directory ~/.ssh and change the permissions to:

```
chmod 400 <student number>-key.pem
```

### [4] Create the instance and note the instance id

```
 aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-d38a4ab1 --security-group-ids <student number>-sg --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name <student number>-key --query 'Instances[0].InstanceId'

 ```
 Optional: Add a tag to your Instance
 ```
  aws ec2 create-tags --resources i-??????? --tags Key=Name,Value=<student number>
 ```

// 18.04 ami-176aa375


### [5] Get the public IP address

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-<instance id from above> --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].PublicIpAddress'
```

### [6] Connect to the instance
```
ssh -i <student number>-key.pem ubuntu@<IP Address>
```
### [7] Look at the instance using the AWS console

### [8] ****NOTE*****

Once you have finished, log onto the console and terminate the instance
or
```
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-<your instance id>
```

## Create an EC2 instance with Python Boto script

### [1] Repeat the steps above using the equivalent Boto commands in a python script. The script should output the IP address to connect to.


Optional: Create an EC2 instance using the console interface. Are there any differences from doing through the command line?

## Using Docker

### [1] Install Docker
```
sudo apt install docker.io -y
```

You may have to

```
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### [2] Check the version

```
docker --version
```

### [3] Build and run an httpd container

Create a directory called html

Edit a file index.html and add the following content

```
  <html>
    <head> </head>
    <body>
      <p>Hello World!</p>
    </body>
  </html>
```

### [4] Create a file called “Dockerfile” in the directory above with the following content:

```
FROM httpd:2.4
COPY ./html/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
```

### [5] Build the docker image

```
docker build -t my-apache2 .
```

If you run into permission errors, you may need add your user to the docker group:

```
sudo usermod -a -G docker <username>
```

Be sure to log out and log back in for this change to take effect.

### [6] Run the image

```
docker run -p 80:80 -dit --name my-app my-apache2
```

### [7] Open a browser and access address http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1 Confirm you get Hello World!

### [8] Other commands

To check what is running

```
docker ps -a
```

To stop and remove the container

```
docker stop my-app
docker rm my-app
```

Lab Assessment:
Please submit a single zip file containing:
1. The files index.html, Dockerfile and the rest of linux commands in a single run.sh file.
2. Screenshots of your terminal with the outputs from each step.
