1) EC2 vs Lambda
2) DevOps
What is devops?
- automate dev process
- enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments
- encompasses several DevOps concepts: continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), and continuous deployment
- Continuous delivery is the practice of testing new code as it’s integrated, extending the velocity of continuous integration. Continuous delivery automates the testing and staging of new code to prepare it for deployment.
- Continuous deployment is the process of automating the release of new code as it’s integrated and approved through continuous integration and continuous delivery. Code that’s successfully tested through the automated delivery processes is staged and released into the production environment, 


3. Docker Containers
Web Architectures vs Serverless Architectures
Load Balancers
STorage Technologies: S3, DynamoDB, RDS 
ML ( Supervised learning) : SageMaker, Rekognition, Lex, Comprehend, Metrics, Overfitting, Underfitting.

**SageMaker**: cloud platform for creating, training and deploying maching learning models.including labeling, data preparation, feature engineering,
statistical bias detection, auto-ML, training, tuning, hosting, explainability, monitoring, and workflows.
With built-in docker containers and built-in algorithms  containers you can train machine learning algorithms and deploy models quickly and reliably at any scale. 

- Lex: AWS for text and image
Other technologies: Elastic Transcoder, POlly

Cloudwatch = logging Ec2
Integrate with services. Combination of EC2 . WEb application EC2 and some functionalities

1) 
Lambda or Serverless function ( you pay for execution) Executin of lambda function. it is good when the volume is not high. Temporary ec2. 
lambda has a role associated with it roles give access to S3. 
Configuration of lambda function  10 GB max. or 1 GB and how many seconds. If company is growing exponentially. 
smallest one 20 30 dollars per month.  50 cents for a year. 
EC2 you have to pay even if you stop and EBS.

4 ) Elastic Transcoder processing 
Kinesis = streaming services real time streaming 

Use cases:
images 


Questions:
types or formats: S3.                        EBS no API 
DynamoDB - json like format               RDS - BLOB not recommended 
Serverside encryption 
Avoid deletion: policies, users, 
key is accidental deleting: versionig is good.   pros and cons

 1. Content moderation
    - image and video analysis with machine learning
 2. Face compare and search
    - Determine the similarity of a face against another picture or from your private image repository.
 3. Face detection and analysis
    - Detects potentially unsafe, inappropriate, or unwanted content across images and videos

Use cases for facial recognition
a. Retail and hospitality – Whether it’s keeping tabs on density limits or providing foot traffic analysis, there are various ways in which facial recognition can be used in retail and hospitality settings. And with the coronavirus pandemic forcing businesses to keep track of their customers, facial recognition can also help automate the check-in process. In China, cameras run a facial recognition algorithm to identify shoppers whenever they enter JD stores. It can even facilitate contactless buying when used in parallel with RFID tags.
b. Transport and logistics – Self-driving cars have been the focus of facial recognition research in automotive and transport settings. For example, identity verification is being considered to unlock and start a vehicle for its owner. A similar system could also be used for logistics, where long-distance drivers are often required to verify their identity and prove they are the ones driving.
c. Education – With the coronavirus pandemic putting paid to in-person examinations where invigilators must be present, the education industry has capitalised on technologies like Amazon Rekognition to verify identities and eliminate cheating. This brings us onto Rekogniton’s next capability…


4. Label Detection (Image and Video)
Use Cases for Label Detection
a. Retail – Once again, retail is one industry that stands to gain a great deal from custom labels. For example, it could be used to identify products and detect brands on a shelf to help with personalised recommendations or inventory management.
b. Agriculture – AWS gives the example of a tomato producer that needed to classify produce into six ripeness categories from mature green to red. Instead of doing so manually, it used custom labels to classify tomatoes based on their ripeness and integrated this solution into the packaging process.
c. Media – Custom labels can make content more discoverable on digital platforms as it improves metadata. For example, Rekognition can automatically tag and label objects such as logos, characters, actors, scenes, and locations, which can then be indexed to make content searchable. This leads to more personalised recommendations and a better content discovery experience for users.
